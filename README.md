# Smart-irrigation-using-IOT
With how busy our lives are, it's sometimes easy to forget to pay a little attention to your thirsty indoor plants until it's too late and you are left with a crusty pile of yellow carcasses. Instead of constantly replacing those plants, we'll show you how to make a compact, automated, raspberry pi powered gardener to water and light your plants. This gardener's memory is impeccable, and assists you in watering your plant in a smarter way.

Objective of the project:

	Smart irrigation is a key component of precision agriculture. It helps farmers avoid water wastage and improve the quality of crop growth in their fields by: 
	Irrigating at the correct times, 
	Minimizing runoffs and other wastages 
	Determining the soil moisture levels accurately 
	Replacing manual irrigation with automatic valves and systems also does away with the human error element (e.g. forgetting to turn off a valve after watering the field), and is instrumental in saving energy, time as well as resources. 
	Determining the soil moisture levels accurately thereby helps in finding the irrigation requirements at that place.
	The installation and configuration of smart irrigation systems is fairly straightforward which helps the average user.
